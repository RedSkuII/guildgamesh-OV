# Guildgamesh Resource Tracker

A comprehensive resource management and tracking portal with Discord authentication and role-based access control. Perfect for gaming communities, organizations, and teams that need to track shared resources, inventory, or assets.

Originally designed for Dune Awakening guilds, but can be adapted to track any type of resources. Supports **multiple Discord servers** with **multiple in-game guilds per server**. Each in-game guild belongs to only one Discord server, but Discord servers can manage multiple guilds independently.

This project is open to the community - if you can build it and it works, pull requests are welcome! 🙏

NEXTAUTH_SECRET=your_long_random_secret_here

# Turso Database (from Step 4)
TURSO_DATABASE_URL=libsql://your-database.turso.io
TURSO_AUTH_TOKEN=your_turso_auth_token

# Optional: Customize branding
NEXT_PUBLIC_ORG_NAME=Your Community Name
```

4. Click **Deploy**

### Step 6: Initialize Database Schema
After deployment, you need to set up your database tables:

1. Install Drizzle CLI locally:
```bash
npm install -g drizzle-kit
```

2. Clone your repository and install dependencies:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/ResourceTracker.git
cd ResourceTracker
npm install
```

TURSO_DATABASE_URL=your_turso_database_url
TURSO_AUTH_TOKEN=your_turso_auth_token
```

4. Run the database migration:
```bash
npm run db:push
```

### Step 7: Populate with Sample Data (Optional)
Add some initial resources to test the app:

```bash
npm run populate-resources-safe
```

### Step 8: Update Discord OAuth Redirect
Go back to your Discord application and update the redirect URI to match your deployed Vercel URL:
- `https://your-actual-vercel-url.vercel.app/api/auth/callback/discord`

### 🎉 You're Done!
Your Resource Tracker is now running for free! Visit your Vercel URL and sign in with Discord.

**Initial Setup After Deployment:**
1. Sign in with your Discord account
2. Go to **Bot Dashboard** to configure your Discord server(s)
3. Select your Discord server from the dropdown (only shows servers you own/admin)
4. If the bot isn't in your server, click "Add Bot to Server"
5. Configure bot channels, roles, and bonus settings
6. Go to **Resources** page and select your in-game guild to start tracking

**Multi-Server & Multi-Guild Configuration:**
- Each Discord server owner/admin can independently configure their bot settings
- **One Discord server can manage MULTIPLE in-game guilds**
- **Each in-game guild can only belong to ONE Discord server** (prevents conflicts)
- Guilds on the same Discord server are completely separate from each other
- Resources, leaderboards, and activity logs are tracked separately per guild
- Switch between guilds using the guild selector dropdown

**Guild Dropdown Behavior:**
- The system automatically retries if guilds don't load immediately
- If you see "No Guilds Available", wait 1-2 seconds for the retry
- This is normal during session authentication - guilds will appear automatically
- No manual refresh needed - the system handles this for you

**Free Tier Limits:**
- **Vercel**: 100GB bandwidth, unlimited projects
- **Turso**: 500 databases, 1B row reads, 1M row writes/month
- **Discord**: Unlimited OAuth usage

## 🤖 Discord Bot Configuration Guide

### Bot Dashboard Features

The Bot Dashboard (`/dashboard/bot`) provides a complete interface for configuring Discord bot integration:

#### 1. **Server Selection**
- **Discord Server Dropdown**: Select which Discord server to configure
  - Automatically sorted: Servers with bot installed first (✅), then servers without bot (⚠️)
  - Owner servers marked with 👑
  - Shows real-time bot presence status
  - Only displays servers where you have Administrator permissions or ownership

- **In-Game Guild Dropdown**: Select which in-game guild (House, Clan) to track
  - Filtered by selected Discord server
  - Links resources to specific Discord communities
  - Each Discord server can track a different in-game guild

#### 2. **Channel Configuration** (Multi-Select)

**Bot Channels** - Where the bot posts notifications
- Select multiple channels (hold Ctrl/Cmd)
- Examples: #announcements, #bot-logs, #resource-tracker
- Used for: Website change notifications, general bot messages
- Visual tags show selected channels with quick removal (×)

**Order Channels** - Where resource orders are created
- Select multiple channels for order management
- Examples: #orders, #requests, #marketplace
- Used for: Public order system, fulfillment tracking
- Supports Discord slash commands for creating/filling orders

#### 3. **Role Configuration** (Multi-Select)

**Admin Roles** - Roles that can access the bot dashboard
- Select multiple roles (hold Ctrl/Cmd)
- Examples: @Admin, @Moderator, @Officers
- Grants access to: Configuration changes, statistics, activity logs
- Separate from resource permissions (controlled via `DISCORD_ROLES_CONFIG`)

#### 4. **Points & Bonus System**

**Discord Order Fulfillment Bonus: 0-200%**
- Default: 50% (1.5x points)
- Controls point multiplier for filling orders via Discord bot
- Examples:
  - 0% = No bonus (1.0x base points)
  - 50% = 1.5x points (recommended)
  - 100% = 2.0x points (double points)
  - 200% = 3.0x points (triple points)
- Encourages Discord-based resource distribution

**Website Addition Bonus: 0-200%**
- Default: 0% (no bonus)
- Controls point multiplier for adding resources via website
- Same scaling as Discord bonus
- Use cases:
  - Set higher to encourage website usage
  - Set lower to prioritize Discord activity
  - Match Discord bonus for equal rewards

#### 5. **Bot Behavior Toggles**

**✅ Auto-update embeds**
- **Enabled**: Bot edits existing embed messages when data changes
- **Disabled**: Creates new messages for each update (historical record)
- Use case: Keep pinned stock messages synchronized in real-time
- Prevents: Channel spam from repeated new messages

**✅ Notify on website changes**
- **Enabled**: Bot posts notifications when resources are added/removed via website
- **Disabled**: Only Discord-based changes trigger notifications
- Use case: Keep Discord community informed of website activity
- Example: "🔔 @Username added 1000x Iron Ore (+10 points)"

**✅ Allow public orders**
- **Enabled**: Any guild member can create resource requests via Discord
- **Disabled**: Only admins/designated roles can manage orders
- Use case: Democratic resource distribution vs. centralized control
- Example command: `/order create Metal Alloy 500`

### Bot Integration Workflow

#### For Server Owners:

1. **Add Bot to Discord Server**
   - Select server from dropdown
   - If bot not present, click "Add Bot to Server" button
   - Authorize with Administrator permissions
   - Refresh page to see configuration panel

2. **Configure Channels & Roles**
   - Select notification channels (where bot posts updates)
   - Select order channels (where users can request resources)
   - Assign admin roles (who can modify bot settings)
   - All fields support multiple selections

3. **Set Point Bonuses**
   - Adjust Discord order fulfillment bonus (0-200%)
   - Adjust website addition bonus (0-200%)
   - Balance between Discord and website engagement

4. **Enable Features**
   - Toggle auto-update embeds (recommended: ON)
   - Toggle website notifications (recommended: ON for active guilds)
   - Toggle public orders (ON for community-driven, OFF for admin-controlled)

5. **Save Configuration**
   - Click "Save Configuration" button
   - Settings are stored per Discord server
   - Each server can have completely different settings

#### For Discord Bot (Separate Python Bot):

The website provides the configuration API, but you need a Discord bot to use these features:

**Required Bot Setup:**
1. Create bot at Discord Developer Portal
2. Enable required intents: Server Members Intent
3. Copy bot token to `DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN` environment variable
4. Implement bot commands using your preferred framework (Discord.js, discord.py, etc.)
5. Read configuration from `/api/bot/config/{guildId}` endpoint

**Example Bot Features to Implement:**
- `/stock` - Show current resource levels (reads from website API)
- `/order create [item] [quantity]` - Create resource request
- `/order fill [order_id]` - Fulfill an order (awards bonus points)
- `/leaderboard` - Show top contributors
- Auto-update embeds when website data changes
- Post notifications when resources are added via website

**API Endpoints for Bot:**
- `GET /api/bot/config/{guildId}` - Get bot configuration
- `GET /api/resources?guildId={guildId}` - Get resources
- `GET /api/leaderboard?guildId={guildId}` - Get leaderboard
- `PUT /api/resources` - Update resources (awards points)

### Multi-Server & Multi-Guild Architecture

**Many-to-One Relationship:**
- **One Discord server → Multiple in-game guilds** ✅
- **One in-game guild → Only ONE Discord server** ✅
- Guilds on the same Discord server remain completely separate (no shared data)

**How It Works:**
1. **Multiple Guilds per Discord Server**: Your Discord can track "House Melange", "Whitelist Second Guild", and others
2. **Guild Exclusivity**: Once a guild is linked to your Discord server, other Discord servers cannot claim it
3. **Independent Tracking**: Each guild has separate resources, leaderboards, and activity logs
4. **Easy Switching**: Use the guild selector dropdown to switch between your server's guilds

**Best Practices:**
1. **Clear Ownership**: Each in-game guild is managed by one Discord community only
2. **Separate Management**: Guilds on your server don't share resources or points
3. **Organized Structure**: Perfect for alliances managing multiple Houses/Clans from one Discord
4. **Scalability**: Add unlimited guilds to your Discord server as your organization grows

**Example Scenarios:**
- **Single Guild**: One Discord server managing one in-game guild (simplest setup)
- **Alliance Management**: One Discord server tracking 3 different Houses independently
- **Multi-Faction**: Gaming community with separate Clans, all managed from one Discord
- **Switching Between Guilds**: Users select which guild to view/edit via dropdown (no data mixing)

### Troubleshooting

**Guild dropdown showing "No Guilds Available"?**
- This is normal during initial page load - wait 1-2 seconds
- The system automatically retries authentication and fetches guilds
- Guilds will appear automatically without manual refresh
- If issue persists after 5 seconds, try refreshing the page once
- Check that you've granted Discord OAuth permissions (identify, guilds, guilds.members.read)

**Bot not appearing in server list?**
- Ensure you have Administrator permissions or ownership
- Check OAuth scopes include `guilds` and `guilds.members.read`
- Try signing out and back in to refresh Discord token

**Can't save configuration?**
- Ensure bot is added to the server first
- Check that you selected at least one channel/role (or leave empty for none)
- Verify in-game guild is selected
- Check browser console for detailed error messages

**Bot commands not working?**
- Configuration is stored, but bot implementation is separate
- Refer to your Discord bot codebase (Discord.js/discord.py)
- Ensure bot has proper permissions in configured channels
- Check bot token is valid in environment variables
